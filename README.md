This repository allow me to make a bridge between the repositories xgpu and xgpu-samples. 

The script "doc" in the package.json from xgpu do :
- npx tsjsondoc ./src ../xgpu-documentation
- cd..
- cd xgpu-documentation
- git add . 
- git commit -m "update documentation"
- git push (this push will be triggered by netlify that will update the page online )
- cd ..
- cd xgpu


From xgpu-samples point-of-view, the documenation become a simple iframe 

In short, it allow me to update the documentation online without needing to update xgpu and/or xgpu-samples 


It's also a good sample to expose how to use the json object generated by the library tsjondoc and the reason why I built this library in a first place :)
